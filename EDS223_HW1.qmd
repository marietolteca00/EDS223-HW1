#### Interpretation:
Low-Income: For my interpretation of the percentile for low income, it is evident that in the Oxnard Plain areas (Oxnard, San Buenaventura, and Port Hueneme) and Santa Paula, have a bigger Percentile of Low Income population. This could be because of the type of jobs around these areas, agriculture fields, and construction. Majority of this area consist of the 101- Freeway that means these lower income communities get hit with a big part of particulate matter. Personally, I grew up around these areas, in particular North Oxnard, where it has undergone gentrification and continues to go.

#### Interpretation:
Particulate Matter 2.5: With the increase of infrastructure I assumed the increase of particulate matter would come into play. In addition to the increase of particulate matter 2.5 Ventura County has been recently affect with a rise in wildfires. Wildfires have increased within the last few years mostly in the mountains where dry areas are common, as well as dry river beds with invasive species. In Ventura County the low income population seems to be exposed to more air pollution, showcasing an environmental injustice to certain residents.

Overall, using this the `tmap` package, I focused in Ventura County to look at the Low Income population and Particulate Matter 2.5. I was interested to look at the low income population since some areas are being improved more than others, particularly the area in North Oxnard where you can see a dark shade of red. I grew up un this area and lot of gentrification has occurred throughout my lifetime. Being able to document and visually see the population of low income come being affected by new construction is saddening. With the two maps we are able to see that the low income population is affected by environmental injustice.

## For Fun - The State of California Low-Income Population and Air toxics of Cancer Risk in California
# PLEASE DO NOT MARK OFF POINTS🙏

-   Interesting how most of the central valley and surrounding areas have a higher percent of air toxic cancer risk than anywhere else in the state of California. I have a hypothesis of why that might be, the central valley is known to have lots of agriculture fields. It is one of the highest producers throughout California, the pesticides that the agriculture needs might have an affect towards these communities.
